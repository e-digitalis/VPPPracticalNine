/*Stage 1
Create a new class, called Book, with the following fields:
Title - this will store the book’s title - an example might be
“The History of Java”
Author - this will be the name of the person who wrote
the book - an example might be “Matt Greencroft”
ID - this will be a unique identification number for each
book. An example might be 1203947. In a real library, this
number might well be printed somewhere on the book, in
the form of a barcode. It is then scanned by the librarian
when a customer wishes to borrow it.
ISBN - this stands for International Standard Book
Number - it is a unique identifier for each book, which is
assigned by the book’s publisher.*/
	
	/* Stage 2

	initial value of each of its fields.
	Stage 3
